CECS 350:

Phases in history of Cybertechnology:
Phase 1: 1950-1960:
	Computing tech in its infancy
	Very small disk space
	Ignorant people wondered:
		Computers would be "giant brains" - how do we differentiate between computers and humans?
		Privacy - Ignorance of how a computer worked

Phase 2: 1970-1980:
	Computers start networking
	Computers used as communication devices
	Privately owned networks

	Ethical questions that arose:
		Privacy concerns?
		Intellectual property - computers and the "perfect copy"
		Computer crime - hackers and such

Phase 3: 1990-present day:
	WWW become commonplace
	Society is connected all of the time

	Ethical questions that arose:
		Free speech - Censorship?
		Anonymity - Are we protected if we choose to be?
		Jurisdiction - Whose laws rule the web?
	
Phase 4: present day-near future:
	Social networking makes up 1 out of every 4 minutes spent online
	Computers are becoming a part of us

	Ethical questions that are arising:
		Autonomous machines and robots used in war... etc


3 perspectives of applied ethics

	Professional Ethics (normative)
		aims to identify and analyze ethical responsibility for professionals in a field of study
		commonly draw on ethical situations that have arisen in other fields to help guide them to ethical conclusions
		they usually examine ethical issues that can create policy vaccums

		Fields:
			
	Philosophical Ethics (normative)
		uses a 3-part system called the "standard methodology" to offer solutions to more difficult ethical issues
		1. identify a particular controversial practice as a moral problem
		2. define concepts and examine the factual data associated with that concept
		3. apply moral theories and principles to reach a conclusion about the moral issue (take a side)
	Sociological Ethics (descriptive)
		aims to describe and report how society, groups and individuals view a particular moral issue
		if we understand how people view moral issues (descriptive), we can gain insight into the ethical worth of those issues (normative)
		for example, if we know what people consider to be a "friend", we can understand more about the moral issues behind social networking "friends" terminology

Normative approach - Prescribe what ought to be the case
Descriptive approach - Report or describe what is the case
