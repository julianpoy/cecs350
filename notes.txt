CECS 350:

Phases in history of Cybertechnology:
Phase 1: 1950-1960:
    Computing tech in its infancy
    Very small disk space
    Ignorant people wondered:
        Computers would be "giant brains" - how do we differentiate between computers and humans?
        Privacy - Ignorance of how a computer worked

Phase 2: 1970-1980:
    Computers start networking
    Computers used as communication devices
    Privately owned networks

    Ethical questions that arose:
        Privacy concerns?
        Intellectual property - computers and the "perfect copy"
        Computer crime - hackers and such

Phase 3: 1990-present day:
    WWW become commonplace
    Society is connected all of the time

    Ethical questions that arose:
        Free speech - Censorship?
        Anonymity - Are we protected if we choose to be?
        Jurisdiction - Whose laws rule the web?
    
Phase 4: present day-near future:
    Social networking makes up 1 out of every 4 minutes spent online
    Computers are becoming a part of us

    Ethical questions that are arising:
        Autonomous machines and robots used in war... etc


3 perspectives of applied ethics

    Professional Ethics (normative)
        aims to identify and analyze ethical responsibility for professionals in a field of study
        commonly draw on ethical situations that have arisen in other fields to help guide them to ethical conclusions
        they usually examine ethical issues that can create policy vaccums

        Fields:
            
    Philosophical Ethics (normative)
        uses a 3-part system called the "standard methodology" to offer solutions to more difficult ethical issues
        1. identify a particular controversial practice as a moral problem
        2. define concepts and examine the factual data associated with that concept
        3. apply moral theories and principles to reach a conclusion about the moral issue (take a side)
    Sociological Ethics (descriptive)
        aims to describe and report how society, groups and individuals view a particular moral issue
        if we understand how people view moral issues (descriptive), we can gain insight into the ethical worth of those issues (normative)
        for example, if we know what people consider to be a "friend", we can understand more about the moral issues behind social networking "friends" terminology

Normative approach - Prescribe what ought to be the case
Descriptive approach - Report or describe what is the case


Components of activism (Civil disobenience):

ethically motivated (can be twisted by utilitarianism)
accept responsibility
doesnt damage property
non violent
doesn't seek profit


4 categories of hacking:
- Black hat hacking
    - Smash and grab
    - Criminal hacking for fast profit
- White hat hacking
    - When you get permission first, then hack
- Ethical hacking
    - Hacking for a 'good cause'
- Grey hat hacking
    - Everything else


Cyber criminals (steal credit cards, etc) - Black hat
Spammers and adware spreaders - Black hat
Advanced Persistent Threat (IP theft from safe harbor) - Black hat
Corporate spies (APT but from non-safe harbor) - Black hat
Hacktivists - Black hat, Ethical hacking, Grey hat hacking
Cyber Warriors - Black hat, white hat, ethical hacking, grey hat
Rogue hackers - Black hat, Ethical hacking, Grey hat hacking


### Midterm review:
Privacy -
3 types:
- Accessibility
    - Right to be alone
    - Personal protection
- Decisional privacy
    - Freedom to make own decision without being impeded on
- Informational privacy
    - Freedom to information protection
    - Control over your own information

2 differentiators between types of privacy:
- Normative
    - Privacy that is violated when lost. Someone overstepped their bounds.
- Descriptive
    - Privacy that is naturally lost (walking outside)
Descriptive loss becomes normative loss when... (it's subjective)

Errors & failures:
- Problems for individuals
- System failures
- Safety critical failures
Order is important!

Utilitarianism & deontology:
- Utilitarianism
    - Whatever benefits the greatest good
    - Things can be justified
    - Cons:
    - Can be used to work around stuff
- Deontology
    - What is right is right, what is wrong is wrongs
    - Very easy to determine what is 'right'
    - Cons:
    - No grey area
    - Very rigid
    - Policy vaccum weakness
    - Can't choose between bad and bad (no worse)

Cybertechnology:
- Involves data

Positive & negative rights:
- Positive
    - Someone has to do something to help you have that right.
- Negative
    - Nothing is required for you to keep your rights.

Responsibility & Liability:
- Responsibility
    - Not on test
- Liability
    - Not on test

Applied ethics:
- Ethics that can be applied
- Things that we can apply ethics to now
- Types of applied ethics
    - Professional (ethics at work)
    - Philosophical (scientific method)
        - Hypothesis, gather data, apply research
    - Socialogical (observes and reports data)
- Normative & descriptive
    - Normative
        - How ethics *should be* applied
        - Professional and Philosophical
    - Descriptive
        - What is the case
        - Socialogical

Discussion stoppers to ethics:
- People disagree
- Morality is cultural
- People judge others
- Ethics is private

Policy vaccum:
- Gray area not covered by laws

Data gathering:
- Merging
    - Combining databases
- Matching
    - Comparing between datasets
- Mining
    - Identifies non-obvious trends from Merging and Matching
    - Example: Credit risk
